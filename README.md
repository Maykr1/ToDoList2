# ToDoList2

## Description
This is my second iteration of a ToDoList. I would like to note that it is currently not running in Docker Compose, but this may change in the future. You can visit this website at [todo.ethansclark.com](todo.ethansclark.com)

## Technologies
- Java
- Spring Boot
- PostgreSQL
- Docker

## Getting Started

### Running Locally
1. Create a Docker image of PostgreSQL, preferablly of version 17.5:
```bash
docker pull postgres:17.5
```

2. Create a Docker Network:
```bash
docker network create toDo2-postgres-network
```

3. Run a PostgreSQL Container, using the previously created image and network:
```bash
docker run --name pgdb --network toDo2-postgres-network -e POSTGRES_DB=toDo2 -e POSTGRES_USER=sa -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=12345678 -p 5432:5432 -d postgres:17.5
```
This same container can be accessed through the following two commands. The first one will run in your terminal and the other will run in a bash shell, which is generated by the first command:
```bash
docker exec -it < CONTAINER_NAME_OR_ID > bash
psql -U sa -d toDoDatabase
```

4. To run the Spring Application, generate the .jar file (used by the Dockerfile) by doing the following in your terminal:
```bash
./mvnw clean package
```

5. Then build the docker image:
```bash
docker build -t todo2 .
```

6. Then run the docker container. Since `application.yml` is set for inputs on the database, make sure they are equal to the credentials you made in step 3.
```bash
docker run --network toDo2-postgres-network --name toDo2 -e DB_USERNAME=postgres -e DB_PASSWORD=12345678 -p 8080:8080 -d todo2
```

### Running From Home Lab
1. First clone the repository to your homeserver and cd into it:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Maykr1/ToDoList2.git
cd ToDoList2
```

2. Follow all the steps from **Running Locally** above. In the case that ./mvnw clean package command is denied from running, use the `chmod +x ./mvnw` command

3. In case you need to update it, run `git pull origin main`, and it will autoupdate your files for you.
